# BestBuy Bot â€” Open Source GPU/PS5/Xbox Bot

## Description

BestBuy Bot is an Add to cart and Auto Checkout Bot. This auto buying bot can search an item repeatedly on the item page using one keyword. Once the desired item is available it can add to cart and checkout very fast. This auto purchasing BestBuy Bot can work on Firefox Browser so it can run in all Operating Systems. It can run for multiple items simultaneously.

"Running a bot can increase your success chances only ; but does not guarantee that you will successfully cart each time. If you do not agree, then please do not use this code."

## Why???

I built this in response to the severe tech scalping situation that's happening right now. Almost every tech product that's coming out right now is being instantly brought out by scalping groups and then resold at at insane prices. $699 GPUs are being listed for $1700 on eBay, and these scalpers are buying 40 carts while normal consumers can't get a single one. Preorders for the PS5 are being resold for nearly $1000. My take on this is that if I release a bot that anyone can use, for free, then the number of items that scalpers can buy goes down and normal consumers can buy items for MSRP. If everyone is botting, then no one is botting.

### Testing

* Use these product links to test the BOT (Best Buy has disabled `Please Wait` testing - 08/24/2021)
* [AMD - Ryzen 5 5600X](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/amd-ryzen-5-5600x-4th-gen-6-core-12-threads-unlocked-desktop-processor-with-wraith-stealth-cooler/6438943.p?skuId=6438943)
* [AMD - Ryzen 7 5800X](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/amd-ryzen-7-5800x-4th-gen-8-core-16-threads-unlocked-desktop-processor-without-cooler/6439000.p?skuId=6439000)


### Further Details

* Item Keyword corresponds to a keyword in your product name (no spaces allowed)
```
const ITEM_KEYWORD= "3060";
```
* Credit Card CVV  (Not Required. BOT just wont do final checkout)
```
const CREDITCARD_CVV = "***";
```
* Test Mode "YES" will not purchase item. But do all the steps except pressing the last button. ```TESTMODE = "No" ``` will purchase the item.
```
const TESTMODE = "Yes";
``` 
* Last 4 digits of your registered phone # for SMS verification (Not Required. Manual input will be needed on verification screen if left blank)
```
const SMS_DIGITS = "****";

## Workflow

This tool is designed to multitask. That means, it can run in many tabs simultaneously, if there is a ```ITEM_KEYWORD``` overlap.
If there is no ```ITEM_KEYWORD``` overlap. You will need to create a new copy of script for each ```ITEM_KEYWORD```.

Please make sure your CART is empty.

After updating variables and enabling the script in Tampermonkey, go to the your favourite GPU page in BestBuy.
If the Title of GPU has ```ITEM_KEYWORD```, it will add the item to cart and checkout. If item is out of stock it will keep on refreshing every 5 seconds.

Please use ```TESTMODE = "Yes"``` to test with an item already in stock.
